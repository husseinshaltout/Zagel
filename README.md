# Zagel
Zagel is a chat program made and designed to provide a simple, easy and reliable way of communication we chose the name ‘Zagel’ which means homer bird in Arabic that used to be a method of communication without the use of internet and so is Zagel although it can be set to be used over the internet but it can still work over a LAN network. The server take requests from the clients to login or register or chat to specific person. Built with my friend Youssef Elgendy.
